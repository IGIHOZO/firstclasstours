</strong><br>Our Guide will pick you up from Hosea Kutako International Airport which is about 35mins to the&nbsp;capital city of Namibia (Windhoek). The guide will check you in and have a city tour.<br><strong>Day 2: Windhoek to Okonjima Nature Reserve (300km) (Okonjima Plains Camp or similar)&nbsp;</strong><br>You will be picked up at your accommodation at around 08:00 am and transferred to Okonjima&nbsp;which is about 2.5 hours from Windhoek. Okonjima is home to the AfriCat Foundation, a&nbsp;conservation operation that focuses on the long term survival of Namibia's large carnivores in their&nbsp;natural habitat, particularly the cheetah. During the afternoon you will be taken on a tour that will&nbsp;provide more insights into this programme and the opportunity to see some of these majestic&nbsp;animals.<br><strong>Day 3: Okonjima to Etosha National Park, East (300km)(Mushara Lodge or similar)
</strong><br>This morning we make an early start and head off towards the Etosha National Park. We will travel&nbsp;via Lake Otjikoto, which is Namibia's second largest, permanent, natural lake. It is distinguished by&nbsp;its great depth and emerald-green waters. We will rest here and learn about the history and geology&nbsp;of this unusual landmark.&nbsp;Having arrived at Etosha, we will check into our luxury lodge which is situated just outside the Von&nbsp;Lindequist gate on the eastern boundary of the Etosha National Park. Mushara Lodge boasts a small&nbsp;library, bar with extensive wine cellar, an airy lounge area with a fireplace for winter evenings, dining&nbsp;area and curio shop. The well-spaced chalets are arranged around a beautiful swimming pool&nbsp;surrounded by well-manicured lawns.&nbsp;We embark on our first game drive during the cool of the afternoon. The game viewing is usually&nbsp;excellent with close sightings of springboks, zebras, impalas, giraffes, gemsboks and plenty of birds.&nbsp;If we are lucky we may also experience close encounters with elephants and lions. We will return to&nbsp;our accommodation just before sunset.
<br><strong>Day 4: Etosha National Park, South (Etosha Safari Lodge, Gondwana Collection Namibia, or similar)
</strong><br>Today will be spent searching for and observing wildlife. A visit to a number of waterholes is high on&nbsp;the agenda. We will also stop at the Etosha Pan, the “place of dry water”. This extensive, flat&nbsp;depression is about 5,000 km2
<br>. Seeing large herds of game in this setting of shimmering mirages is a&nbsp;unique experience. We may stop at Halali middle camp to have lunch before we continue to our&nbsp;lodge near the southern side of the park.&nbsp;Etosha Safari Lodge is set on a hillock overlooking sprawling mopane woodland. The chalets each&nbsp;have their own private verandah with panoramic views. The main area offers a spacious deck, dining&nbsp;area, bar, lounge and three swimming pools.<br><strong>Day 5: Etosha to Palmwag (320km)(Grootberg Lodge or similar)
</strong><br>We kick start our day with a game drive before leaving the park and driving into the desert 
<br>mountains of the Kaokoveld, one of the last true wildernesses of southern Africa and home of the 
<br>Himba people. During the afternoon we will pay a visit to Otjikandera Himba village where we will 
<br>meet the local inhabitants. A special guide is going to be available for the time we are there. The 
<br>guide will translate for us and introduce us to this indigenous “tribe” of nomadic pastoralists. We will 
<br>learn about their marriage customs, traditional way of life and food and we will visit the “holy fire”.
<br>We spend the night at Grootberg Lodge. Situated at the very edge of the Etendeka Plateau, it offers 
<br>spectacular views over the Klip River Valley. Black rhino and desert elephant freely roam this area. 
<br>Enjoy a sundowner on the deck or a swim in the pool.<br><strong>Day 6: Palmwag to Twyfelfontein, Damaraland (400km)(Mowani Mountain Camp or similar)
</strong><br>Today we will continue further south into Damaraland, travelling through a variety of landscapes.&nbsp;The area is known for desert elephants and, if we are lucky, we might spot some. We will visit the&nbsp;Twyfelfontein UNESCO World Heritage Site featuring one of the largest and most important&nbsp;concentrations of rock art in Africa. We will pass by the Organ Pipes, a striking rock formation of&nbsp;columnar basalts which resemble organ pipes. The afternoon can be spent relaxing at the lodge. Our&nbsp;luxury lodge is set in a stunning location, nestled amongst massive ochre boulders with amazing&nbsp;views over the vast and unspoilt surrounding wilderness. Sunsets here are spectacular.&nbsp;<br><strong>Day 7: Twyfelfontein to Swakopmund, Skeleton Coast (Strand Hotel or similar) (260km)
</strong><br>We depart early to enjoy the cool of the morning. Our first stop is the small town of Uis, an old&nbsp;mining town and one of the best places to buy semi-precious stones for which Namibia is famous.&nbsp;Here rough amethyst, tourmaline and other stones can be found at bargain prices.&nbsp;Having arrived at the coast we drive to Cape Cross, a vast seal colony, north of Swakopmund. Here&nbsp;you are able to get up close to thousands of wild Cape fur seals and observe them in their natural 
<br>environment. Our accommodation at the Strand Hotel offers extensive, unique and creatively&nbsp;entertaining Restaurants, Bars, a Deli, Lobby-Lounge, Sea Facing Terraces, Beach Kiosk and state of&nbsp;the art Conference &amp; Banqueting Centre, all set on the Mole, a historic and iconic site surrounded by&nbsp;ocean on three sides. It is a social epicenter and destination in itself for all visitors to and residents of&nbsp;Swakopmund.&nbsp;Tonight we will dine at one of Swakopmund's excellent restaurants. The seafood here is superb.
<br><strong>Day 8: Swakopmund to Windhoek (360km)
</strong><br>Swakopmund is a charming seaside town characterised by German colonial architecture, palm-lined&nbsp;streets, great restaurants, plenty of shops and beautiful beaches. This morning, you will be free to&nbsp;explore the town on your own. It offers plenty to do including a good museum and aquarium. Your&nbsp;guide will discuss all optional activities with you and offer to make pre-bookings in advance. These&nbsp;include a boat tour (with oysters and champagne), scenic flights and micro-light flights over the&nbsp;desert, fishing trips (either from the beach or a boat), quad-biking in the desert, sandboarding and&nbsp;skydiving. Note that all extra activities in Swakopmund are subject to availability and are made at the 
<br>client's own expense.&nbsp;We return to Windhoek where your guide will drop you off at your accommodation at around 14H30&nbsp;in the afternoon and rest.<br><strong>Day 9: Windhoek 
</strong><br>(43.7km)(Hilton Hotel)&nbsp;Our Guide will drop you off to Hosea Kutako International Airport for your departure. Enjoy your 
<br>travel back home&nbsp;<br></p>
